Patches for ASP.NET MVC 2
=========================

These patches are used in the System.Web.Mvc of S#aml-architecture.

They are intendet to get ASP.NET MVC 2.0 to work under mono 2.4.4
and higher.

All patches are made in a non-destructive way, to not interfere when
used in a framework that has the appropriate functionality working.

The compiled files are tested with:
 - Microsoft .NET 3.5 on Microsoft Windows 7
 - mono 2.4.4 on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server
 - mono 2.6.3 on Microsoft Windows 7
 - mono 2.6.3 on OpenSUSE (VMWare image)
